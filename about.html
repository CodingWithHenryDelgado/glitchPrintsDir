                <h1>Hi There!</h1>
                <p>My name is Henry Delgado, I love creating things, so if you ever need something 3D printed or a new
                    website up and running, I'm your guy!
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    I started 3D printing in 2022. I have had too much fun with this printer and want to share that fun
                    with everyone else. I have 3D printed many figurines and tools for my friends.
                    <br />

                    You have seen my character Heather on my site. She's animated by Three.js! Despite her looks, she's
                    adorable!
                    <br />
